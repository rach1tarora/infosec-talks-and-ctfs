## Story
Amidst the constellation of data in Azure's vast cosmos, a critical zip backup has been lost to the void, erased from the blob storage. Yet, whispers of its essence linger in the form of versions, retrievable by those who navigate the internet's expanse. Your quest, should you choose to accept it, is to traverse the digital nebula to uncover the name of this phantom archive.

Your tools are sharp and your path is clearâ€”versioning is your map, and retrieval is your ship on this Bot Silver Quest.
