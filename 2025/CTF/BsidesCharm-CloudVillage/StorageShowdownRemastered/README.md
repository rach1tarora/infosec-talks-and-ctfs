## Story

In the depths of Azure Bay, a curious crab named Crabby scuttled across the seafloor in search of shiny secrets. Rumor had it, an old container washed ashore near a static reef—one that held more than just sand and shells.

But the reef wasn’t unguarded. Strange flows in the current, twisted like logic puzzles, blocked every path forward. Crabby had no map, just a whisper of a key hidden in plain sight and the instinct to explore what others overlooked.

Only the cleverest creatures could crack the code and pry open the container. Inside? A shimmering flag said to sparkle like the morning tide.

Good luck.
